		<h1 style="color:yellow"> the newsstand - Windows Phone application </h1>
 		<p >The purpose of this application is for users to keep track of technology news from prestigious sources such TechCrunch, Microsoft Blog, or The Hacker News.</p>

       <p> The inspiration of this application comes from the need of people to keep track of the daily tech news without spending too much time. By gathering different new sources in one place, users only have to go to this app to read up on tech news everyday. </p>

        <p>This application is made on Windows Visual Studio 2013. It uses XAML and C#, as well as getting RSS Feed to show the news stories. </p>

        <p> The app is only in Beta version now. Once it is finished, I will post the link to download on Windows Store here. Meanwhile, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/tuandang/thenewstand"> here </a> .

		<h1 style="color:yellow"> JobFair - Android application </h1>
 		<p >The purpose of this application is for users, especially students, to access quick facts about companies, save the companies that they like to their favorites list, take notes, and apply online on companies' websites.</p>

       <p> The inspiration of this application comes from the fact that many students attending job fairs do not know about what the companies do when they approach those companies. This application will give them the chance to look up the companies' information really quickly, so they can have meaningful conversations with the companies' representatives. In addition, students can save their favorite companies so they can go home and look at those comapanies later. They can also take notes about what they need to do, and apply online on the companies' websites.</p>

        <p>This application is made on Eclipse with Android Development tools. It uses XML and Java, as well as SQLite to save information to a local database. </p>

        <p> The app is only in Beta version now. Once it is finished, I will post the link to download on Google Play Store. Meanwhile, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/tuandang/JobFair"> here </a> .

		<h1 style="color:yellow"> Dine-In - Web application </h1>
 		<p >The purpose of this application is for restaurants' dine-in customers to communicate with the restaurants via a smartphone device. This will minimize the role of the waiters and waitresses, saving time for both the customers and the restaurants owners, as well as maximizing profits for restaurants. This application was made at HackTech - the biggest hackathon in Southern California, in January, 2014. </p>

       <p> The inspiration of this application comes from the fact that in a crowded restaurant on a Friday night, customers have to wait a long time until they get helped by the waiters. Much of that time can be saved if customers can just give instructions to the restaurants via their phones. By simply accessing the local server of the restaurant and signing in with a ID generated by the restaurant, customers can order food, ask for cheque, or give other instructions.</p>

        <p>This application is made on Sumline Text Editor. It uses PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and mySQL. </p>

        <p> The link will be posted on this website soon. Meanwhile, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/tuandang/Dine-In"> here </a> .

		<h1 style="color:yellow"> Micromouse - Maze-solving robotic project</h1>
 		<p >This is part of IEEE Micromouse Competition. The purpose of the competition is to get the mouse to go from the lower left corner of the maze to the center of the maze in the fastest time. Participants have 10 minutes to do this, and only the fastest time is recorded. Therefore, the mouse needs to be able to map the maze so it remembers the dead-end paths.</p>

        <p>This project uses Mapple Mini microcontroller, and <a href="http://leaflabs.com/docs/maple-quickstart.html">Maple Mini IDE for software. </a></p>
