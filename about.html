 		<p >My name is Tuan Dang. I am Computer Engineer major at University of California, San Diego. I look forward to graduating from my university in December, 2014.</p>

       <p> I have a great passion in computer science, because
       	of what it can do to change our world to a better place. Not only a subject of study, computer science is the tool that everyone, regardless of age, nationality, and financial background, can use to solve problems we are all facing in this era. Growing up in this historical time of technology advancement, I always learn and gain more skills on a daily basis, so I can have a powerful tool to solve new and challenging problems in the society. </p>

        <p>I am proficient in Java, C, HTML, CSS, which I use to make many of my side projets and class projects. Besides that, I have knowledge of C++, C#, PHP, Javascript, mySQL, Python, and Ruby on Rails. I try to make more projects with the languages I am not proficient in, because I believe that is the best way to learn new languages.</p>
