 		<p >My internship at Arynga was during summer 2013, and it was a software testing position. I was responsible for validating software on a Freescale board on QNX and Ubuntu flatforms.</p>

       <p> Since the software team is in Poland, I had to communicate with them via Skype almost everyday. The testing also involves hardware so I had to be very careful with the board so that I do not break any components, or burn any parts of the board. </p> 



       	<p>What I take away from this internship is that in the real workplace, communication skills are not less, if not even more, important than technical skills. Not being able to communicate well can result in big time and monetary cost. </p>
